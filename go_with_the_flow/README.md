## Abstract

Go-with-the-Flow is an easy and efficient way to control the motion patterns of video diffusion models. It lets a user decide how the camera and objects in a scene will move, and can even let you transfer motion patterns from one video to another.

We simply fine-tune a base model — requiring no changes to the original pipeline or architecture, except: instead of using pure i.i.d. Gaussian noise, we use **warped noise** instead. Inference has exactly the same computational cost as running the base model.

If you create something cool with our model - and want to share it on our website - email rburgert@cs.stonybrook.edu. We will be creating a user-generated content section, starting with whomever submits the first video!

If you like this project, please give it a ★!

## Quick Start: Cut-and-drag Motion Control

Cut-and-drag motion control lets you take an image, and create a video by cutting out different parts of that image and dragging them around.

For cut-and-drag motion control, there are two parts: an GUI to create a crude animation (no GPU needed), then a diffusion script to turn that crude animation into a pretty one (requires GPU).

### 1. Animation Template GUI (Local)

1. Clone this repo, then `cd` into it.
2. Install local requirements:

   `pip install -r requirements_local.txt`

3. Run the GUI:

   `python cut_and_drag_gui.py`

4. Follow the instructions shown in the GUI.

After completion, an MP4 file will be generated. You'll need to move this file to a computer with a decent GPU to continue.

### 2. Running Video Diffusion (GPU)

1. Clone this repo on the machine with the GPU, then `cd` into it.
2. Install requirements:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Warp the noise (replace `<PATH TO VIDEO OR URL>` accordingly):

   `python make_warped_noise.py <PATH TO VIDEO OR URL> --output_folder noise_warp_output_folder`

4. Run inference:

   ```bash
   python cut_and_drag_inference.py noise_warp_output_folder \
       --prompt "A duck splashing" \
       --output_mp4_path "output.mp4" \
       --device "cuda" \
       --num_inference_steps 30
   ```

Adjust folder paths, prompts, and other hyperparameters as needed. The output will be saved as `output.mp4`.
